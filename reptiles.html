<h2>Some stuff about reptiles</h2>
<h3>Reptiles are cold-blooded vertebrates that rely on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature. They have dry, scaly skin that helps prevent water loss, and most breathe air through lungs for their entire lives.<br> Reptiles typically lay eggs with leathery shells, though some give birth to live young. This group includes animals such as snakes, lizards and crocodilians, all of which share a body plan adapted for life on land, even if some spend much of their time in water.</h3>
