<h2>A little info on mammals</h2>
<h3>Mammals are warm-blooded vertebrates that have hair or fur, produce milk to feed their young, and breathe air through lungs throughout their lives. They typically give birth to live young, and many species show strong parental care, protecting and nurturing their offspring as they grow.<br> Mammals live in a wide range of environments,from oceans and forests to deserts and polar regions, and they vary greatly in size, diet, and behavior. Despite this diversity, all mammals share the same fundamental traits that define the group.</h3>
