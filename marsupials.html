<h1>Marsupials</h1>
<h2>Marsupials are things like kangaroos and koalas</h2>
<h3>Marsupials are a group of mammals known for giving birth to relatively undeveloped young that continue growing inside a pouch on the mother’s body. Their defining features include this pouch, called a marsupium, and a unique reproductive system in which the newborns, though tiny and fragile, crawl to the pouch immediately after birth to nurse and develop further.<br>Common examples of marsupials include kangaroos, koalas, and opossums. This way of raising young allows marsupials to thrive in a variety of environments, especially in Australia and nearby regions where most species are found.</h3>
