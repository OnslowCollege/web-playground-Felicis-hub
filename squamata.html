<h1>Squatmata</h1>
<h2>Squatmata are mainly lizards and snakes</h2>
<h3>Squamata is the largest order of reptiles, encompassing lizards, snakes, and amphisbaenians (worm lizards). Members of this group are characterized by their overlapping scales, highly flexible skulls, and, in many species, the ability to shed their tails as a defense mechanism.<br> Squamatas inhabit nearly every environment on Earth,from deserts and forests to grasslands and urban areas,and they display enormous diversity in size, behavior, and diet. Their adaptability and wide distribution make them one of the most successful reptile groups in the world.</h3>
