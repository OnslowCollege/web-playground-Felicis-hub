<h1>Amphibians</h1>
<h2>A quick run down on amphibians</h2>
<h3>Amphibians are vertebrates that typically begin life as aquatic larvae with gills and later transform into air-breathing adults through metamorphosis. They have moist, permeable skin that allows them to absorb water and oxygen, and this often ties them to damp environments. Unlike reptiles, which have dry, scaly skin and rely more heavily on lungs for breathing, amphibians use both their skin and lungs for respiration.<br> Amphibians generally lay soft, jelly-like eggs in water, while reptiles usually produce eggs with leathery shells that can be laid on land. This combination of features makes amphibians an important bridge between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.</h3>
