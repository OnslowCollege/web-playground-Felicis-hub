<h1>Crocodilia</h1>
<h2>Crocodiles, who could've guessed that</h2>
<h3>Crocodilia is an order of large, predatory reptiles that includes crocodiles, alligators, caimans, and gharials. Members of this group are characterized by their elongated bodies, powerful tails, and tough, armored skin made of bony plates called osteoderms. They are well adapted to an aquatic lifestyle, with eyes and nostrils positioned on top of their heads so they can see and breathe while mostly submerged.<br> Crocodilians are also known for their strong jaws, complex social behaviors, and attentive parental care. Found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions, they play important roles as apex predators in freshwater and coastal ecosystems.</h3>
