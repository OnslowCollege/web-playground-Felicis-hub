<h1>Anura</h1>
<h2>Anura encompases most species of frog</h2>
<h3>Anura is the order of amphibians that includes all frogs and toads, known for their tailless bodies and powerful hind legs adapted for jumping. Most anurans begin life as aquatic tadpoles before undergoing metamorphosis into airbreathing adults with lungs. They typically have moist skin that helps with respiration and water absorption, and many species are highly vocal, using calls to attract mates or defend territory. Found on every continent except Antarctica, anurans play important ecological roles as both predators and prey in freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems.</h3>
